# **Reinforcement Learning for Route Optimization**  

## **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data, RL relies on the trial-and-error approach.  

- **Key Concepts in RL**:  
  - **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.  
  - **Environment**: Everything the agent interacts with.  
  - **State**: The current situation of the agent.  
  - **Action**: A choice the agent makes to change states.  
  - **Reward**: Feedback the agent receives after performing an action.  
  - **Policy**: The strategy that defines the agent's actions in different states.  

### **Why Use Reinforcement Learning?**  
- RL is ideal when:  
  - Data is not labeled or readily available.  
  - Actions directly influence future rewards.  
  - You need to optimize sequential decision-making.  

### **When to Use Reinforcement Learning?**  
- Problems involving dynamic and sequential processes.  
- Scenarios like:  
  - Game playing (e.g., chess, Go, video games).  
  - Robotics (e.g., teaching a robot to walk).  
  - Autonomous driving (e.g., lane navigation).  
  - Resource management (e.g., cloud computing).  

### **Applications of RL**  
- Self-driving cars  
- Recommendation systems  
- Financial portfolio management  
- Traffic light control systems  
- Route optimization

## **Q-Learning in Detail**  
Q-Learning is a model-free RL algorithm. It allows an agent to learn the optimal action-selection policy by updating a Q-table.  

### **How Does Q-Learning Work?**  
1. **Q-Table Initialization**:  
   - The table stores the expected future rewards for state-action pairs.  
   - Initially, all values are set to zero.  

2. **Agent Interaction**:  
   - The agent explores the environment and selects an action based on an exploration-exploitation strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy).  


3. **Q-Value Update Rule**  
The Q-value update formula is:  

```text
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α * [r + γ * max(Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a)]
```  

Where:  
- `Q(s, a)`: Current Q-value for state `s` and action `a`.  
- `α` (Alpha): Learning rate, controls how much new information overrides the old.  
- `r`: Immediate reward received after taking action `a`.  
- `γ` (Gamma): Discount factor, balances immediate vs. future rewards.  
- `max(Q(s', a'))`: Maximum Q-value for the next state `s'` and all possible actions.  

4. **Termination**:  
   - The algorithm ends when the Q-table converges (values stabilize).

## **Project Structure**  
This repository contains two distinct implementations of RL-based route optimization. Both use OpenRouteService for route generation and Q-learning for selecting the optimal path.  

### **Folder Contents**  
- `route_optimization_v1.py`:  
  - Implements the first version of the project.  
  - Uses a straightforward RL framework with uniform random exploration.  

- `route_optimization_v2.py`:  
  - Introduces variations in parameters, visualization, and exploration strategies.  



## **Files in Detail**  

### **1. route_optimization_v1.py**  
#### Overview:  
- This file generates multiple routes between two locations.  
- Trains an RL agent to find the optimal route using Q-learning.  
- Highlights explored paths and the final optimal path on a map.  

#### Key Sections:  
1. **Initialization**:  
   - Sets up OpenRouteService API and defines coordinates.  
2. **Path Generation**:  
   - Creates 10 random paths with deviations for variability.  
   - Stores these paths in a list.  
3. **Q-Learning Implementation**:  
   - Defines the reward system:  
     - High reward for optimal paths.  
     - Penalty for others.  
   - Trains the agent over multiple episodes.  
4. **Visualization**:  
   - Displays all paths (gray), explored paths (red), and the optimal path (blue).  
   - Saves the map as `optimal_and_explored_paths_map.html`.  

(Add **images/screenshots** of:  
1. The map showing routes.  
2. Training logs or console outputs.)

### **2. route_optimization_v2.py**  
#### Overview:  
- A refined implementation of RL for route optimization.  
- Introduces parameter variations and improved exploration strategies.  

#### Key Features:  
1. **Dynamic Route Generation**:  
   - Generates 8 unique paths with smaller deviations.  
2. **Reward System**:  
   - Increased goal rewards and slightly harsher penalties.  
3. **Improved Visualization**:  
   - Highlights visited paths in orange and the optimal path in blue.  
4. **Q-Matrix Analysis**:  
   - Outputs the final Q-matrix and selects the best route based on cumulative rewards.  

#### Enhancements Over v1:  
- Better exploration-exploitation trade-off with reduced randomness.  
- Visualization improvements for better differentiation of paths.  
- Faster convergence by fine-tuning hyperparameters.  

(Add **before-and-after comparison screenshots** of the maps generated by v1 and v2 to showcase enhancements.)
